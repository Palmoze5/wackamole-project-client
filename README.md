### jokesOnYou
## An app for aspiring comedians to make, update, view and delete their jokes.
I want to do a JOKES API for ONE user (One to Many) - it would be conceptualized as an API for beginner level comedians who want to CREATE a joke or list of jokes, to READ (so they could refer and reflect), UPDATE (if they felt the joke needed a little more pizzazz or different angle) and DELETE (if they thought the joke didn’t get them any laughs when told in front of family/friends, strangers or small shows). I recently came up with the idea after reading a chapter in a book
titled, 'The Comedy Bible', by Judy Carter. I like to crack jokes, because it's not only a
stress reliever, but it also puts people around me in good spirits, motivated and productive
for their moments. I may not be the best joker, but I am a student, and I love learning what
makes people laugh and what doesn't. Which is why before this project, I was informally keeping
tabs on what things I posted on slack received emojis or text responses and what did not. I also
kept tabs on things that I said vocally in class that either got a roar from my peers or absolutely crickets.

## Scope of Project
Design and implement API
Design and implement client
Deploy apps
Make API for front end and back end
Make a repository for both front end and back end
via heroku and github

### Work flow - Planning and Development
1.) I developed an ERD of the one user to many jokes diagram
2.) I wrote out user stories (link is below):
a.) For authorizations
b.) For creating, viewing, updating and deleting their jokes
3.) Created a wireframe of several pages describing the user
experience and interface (view link below)
4.) I utilized notes taken from General Assembly
5.) Worked on the back end first
6.) Worked on the front end second
7.) Within the front end, I worked on each folder and file
one at a time.
8.) The process would entail, work on one part of a feature (e.g.
sign up), then test.
9.) Add and commit on a success on feature
10.) Push to the remote repository
11.) Any issues would utilize outside sources (notes, google, then General Assembly issue queue)

## Technologies Used

JavaScript
Handlebars.js
jQuery

### User Stories
1.) As a user, I want to be able to < sign up > so that < I can have a User ID to be able to Sign In to Create, Read (view one or all), Update and Delete my jokes under my profile.>
2.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign In > so that < whenever I log in, anything that I Created, Updated or Deleted would be remembered under my User ID.
3.) As a user, once i’ve signed up and signed in with a User ID  I want to be able to < change my password > so that < I can change my password that’s either memorable or in case I am worried about misplacing my password or sharing my password unknowingly >.
4.) As a user, I want to be able to < Sign Out > so that < I do not have to worry about anyone going into my account to either steal, delete or manipulate my jokes >.
5.) As a user, I want to be able to < have a Create button > so that < I can make and add/store jokes to my user ID >
6.) As a user, I want to be able to < have a View button > so that < I can view all the jokes i’ve created under my user ID >
7.) As a user, I want to be able to < have an Update button > so that < I can add onto already existing jokes to my user ID >
8.) As a user, I want to be able to < have a Delete button > for jokes I hated, so that < I can delete jokes from my jokes list >

## Future considerations:
1.) Better front facing User Interface and experience
a.) Better looking fonts, background, buttons
2.) Make it more of an interactive thing for users
3.) Catered more towards the aspiring comic world.
